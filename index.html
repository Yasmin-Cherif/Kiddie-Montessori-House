	<h2 id="container">Our Education Approach</h2>
	<p>We help setting your child up for the rest of their life by targeting 	your child’s brain & physical development. Studies have shown that 	during the first significant years of the child’s life the brain is still flexible and can embrace taught tools to successfully face the challenges of growing up such as managing mistakes, failure, change and fear. 
	Our Montessori based program is crafted to assist children between the age of 2-5 years to develop a positive way of thinking that supports their interaction with the environment in a courageous and successful way. We embrace a refined combination of philosophies such as Reggio Emilia, High scope and Waldorf and the newest approaches to positive education based on Montessori methodology. The program focuses on developing the following skills:

<h2>A letter from the Founder</h2>
<p>I am a Child Educator expert and a Wisdom kids Life Coach with over 25 years of education experience. </p>

<h2> Kiddie Montessori House Program </h2>
<p> Our Kiddie Montessori House radiates an interactive, warm, and safe Montessori atmosphere where your little child’s curious mind develops in a whole different world, which is considered an extension of home. </p>

<p>The environment is trusted as a second home to your child that sounds very nurturing and cultivates self-confidence, independence, and critical thinking. It features a reception area, a main classroom, and an outdoor space, which has an area for sand and water play and appropriate climbing equipment as well as materials for outdoor gross motor activities. </p> 

<p>Your child will have the opportunity to explore, learn, socialize, communicate, care for one another, problem solve, and to just have fun. Everything in the classroom has been prepared with their needs in mind. Our founder/ educator is trained to observe each child ‘s innate sense of wonder and curiosity and assist them to discover things they are most interested in learning about whether in <b>Practical life</b>, <b>Sensorial</b>, <b>Math</b>, <b>Language</b>, and <b>Culture</b> as well as <b>Art</b> and <b>outdoor area</b>.(<a href="https://Montessori-ami.org"></a>Montessori program).</p>

<p>The afternoon program consists of additional activities such as Cooking, Music, Yoga, Crafts, Construction, Roleplay, Coaching through storytelling & props, and sciences experiments. </p>
<p>The program is delivered in English and French. We also offer Arabic language on demands, enhancing learning through action songs, storytelling, games, and child-age-appropriate activities. </p>
<p>Equally, we will cover a wide range of topics and general concepts, including Geography, Science and Botany. Our location in the heart of NDG neighborhood lends itself very well to picnics and hands on discovery in the parcs. Through these outdoor activities, children will learn how to enjoy the outdoor area in a safe and protected manner. The safety, greenery, and quietness that conquer the atmosphere of this location also promote nature walks. We understand that during the formative years children need opportunities to exercise their gross motor skills, thus, regular walks will be arranged as an extension to the culture and Art curriculum. These walks will not only enhance motor skills, but also satisfy your child’s interest in understanding the world. During nature walks, children will have the opportunity to develop their innate curiosity by exploring nature, making leaf art, and examining their natural collections.</p>
<p>Our program is subsidized by Lieu des Petits in Montreal, Quebec, and will be offered in compliance with the Bureau Coordinator guidelines and regulations. Admission will be dealt with directly at the Kiddie Montessori House.  All the required documentation and the required fee must be paid before a child can be left at the nursery. </p>
<p>Please refer to our Instagram for further information on activities. We look forward to a successful year with our kiddies. Thank you for your support in making this program happen. </p>

<h2> A little about Wisdom coaching </h2>
<h3>Inspiring and empowering kids one story at a time</h3>
<p> Aimed for ages 5-9 years, the Wisdom coaching program teaches kids how to use the power of their thoughts to create happiness, confidence, and success in their lives. 

<p>Recent studies have shown that love from parents is essential but not enough to raise a resilient child who can manage their feelings and thoughts in a positive way. This coaching programs aims to assist children struggling with low self-esteem, fears, and self-doubt. The program aids them in adapting to changes, in seeking action rather than perfection, and in managing their mistakes. Fida is passionately dedicating her 25 years of education experience to empower the future generation of leaders in growing confidently, fostering self-trust, having strong ambitions and achieving their goals. 
</p> Having the ability and the knowledge to instill resilience, confidence and ambition in your little one is a true luxury. </p>
