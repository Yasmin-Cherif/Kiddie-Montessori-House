<h2>A letter from the Founder</h2>
<p>I am a Child Educator expert and a Wisdom kids Life Coach with over 25 years of education experience. </p>
<p>Over the course of my high education journey in the USA, I developed a distinctive educational approach. My bachelor’s degree in early childhood education along with the Montessori training programs and the kids’ life coaching training courses have all nourished my perspective of child education that is known for encouraging creative & positive thinking, creating possibilities, reinforcing flow of attention, searching for the information, and embracing individuality through learning by doing at the child’s pace.</p>

 <p>Throughout my career, I have been a teacher, a program coordinator, a preschool manager, an education consultant, and a kid's life coach. I believe that every child deserves an education that fulfills their full mental and physical potential.</p>

  <p>Today, I take the pride to carefully provide a crafted warm and nurturing Montessori environment at Kiddie Montessori House that offers individual attention to every child for the sake of the joy of learning and positive development of our community children.</p>
